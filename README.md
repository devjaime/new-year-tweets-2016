Happy New Year 2016 around the World
====================================

Just like [last year](http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/composing-christmas/) and the 
[year](http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/japan-advent-art/index.html) 
[before](http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/japan-advent-art-en/), I wanted to participate in the
[#FsAdvent](https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2015/10/25/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2015/)
event, where someone writes a blog post about something they did with F# during December. 
Thanks to [Sergey Tihon](https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/) for the organization of the English
version and the [Japanese F# community](http://connpass.com/event/22056/) for coming up with the 
idea a few years ago!

As my blog post ended up on 31 December, I wanted to do something that would fit well with the
theme of ending of 2015 and starting of the new year 2016 and so I decided to write a little 
interactive web site that tracks the "Happy New Year" tweets live across the globe. This is
partly inspired by [Happy New Year Tweets](http://twitter.github.io/interactive/newyear2014/)
from Twitter in 2014, but rather than analyzing data in retrospect, you can watch 2016 come live!

See it live & read more

Without further ado, here are the important links:

 - [Happy New Year 2016 around the World](http://newyear-tweets.cloudapp.net/) live web site!<br />
   (It will stay alive for a few days around 31 December 2015, but not forever.)   
 - [F# source code for the project](https://github.com/tpetricek/new-year-tweets-2016) on GitHub<br />
   (Feel free to modify it and use it for other events!)
 - [Post with all the technical details](http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/happy-new-year-tweets) on my blog
 

Demo from before the New Year
-----------------------------

Here is a brief screenshot showing the project on December 29. There are a couple of wishes already:
